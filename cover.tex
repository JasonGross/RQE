What follows is the article ``A Framework for Building Verified Partial Evaluators'' authored by Jason Gross (myself), Adam Chlipala, and Andres Erbsen, submitted to PLDI'20, the ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation, which will take place June 15--20, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

Since my contribution is not clearly identified in the conference paper, I describe the distribution of authorship here.
Nearly all of the implementation and proof work of the partial evaluator, the artifact described in this paper, was done by me; others have co-authored some of the common utility files (such as the library on facts about binary integers), and much of arithmetic templates of Fiat Cryptography, used as the main case-study for this paper, were written by Andres Erbsen and Jade Philipoom.
The design of the rewriter was hashed out with help from Andres Erbsen, Jade Philipoom, and Adam Chlipala over the course of many discussions.
All performance tests and aggregation of results were done by me.
I wrote most of the technical content of the paper; Adam contributed technical explanations of some of the prior work.
Adam also organized most of the paper and wrote most of the introduction and related works sections, as well as most of the prose gluing the various paragraphs about technical content together, with some help from me and Andres.
